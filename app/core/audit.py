# Design note: log_action() is called by almost every endpoint, even plain
# read-only GETs, so nearly every HTTP request also performs a SQLite write.
# WAL mode resolves reader-versus-writer contention but not writer-versus-writer
# contention (only one writer at a time, even in WAL), so "database is locked"
# can resurface under concurrent requests despite the 30 s timeout.
#
# Instead of writing to SQLite from every calling thread, a single dedicated
# thread owns audit-log writes: callers enqueue the entry (fast, non-blocking,
# no SQLite in the request thread) and return immediately, and the writer thread
# processes entries one at a time. That gives a single writer for the path that
# accounts for most of the application's write volume. Other tables are still
# written directly elsewhere, so this does not remove every possible concurrent
# write, only the most frequent source.
#
# The queue is bounded: in an extreme burst put_nowait() fails rather than
# blocking the calling request forever. The corresponding audit entry is then
# lost (logged to stderr), which is preferable to slowing the application down
# for a secondary log.
